Let $A'$ be the image of the reflection of point $A$ over the line $BC$. Compute the square of the distance from the incenter of $\triangle A'BC$ and the center of $\omega$.","Place the triangle in the coordinate plane with  

\[
C=(0,0),\qquad B=(3,0),\qquad A=(0,4)
\]

so that \(BC=3,\; CA=4,\; AB=5\) and \(\angle C=90^{\circ}\).

---

### The circle \(\omega\)

A circle tangent to the segment \(AB\) and to the rays \(\overrightarrow{CB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CA}\) must be tangent to the two legs of the right angle at \(C\) and to the hypotenuse \(AB\).  
Hence \(\omega\) is precisely the incircle of \(\triangle ABC\).

For a right triangle with legs \(a,b\) and hypotenuse \(c\),

\[
r=\frac{a+b-c}{2}
\]

is the inradius.  
Here \(a=3,\;b=4,\;c=5\), so  

\[
r=\frac{3+4-5}{2}=1 .
\]

Thus the incenter (center of \(\omega\)) is at  

\[
I=(r,r)=(1,1).
\]

---

### Point \(A'\)

Reflect \(A\) across line \(BC\) (the \(x\)-axis).  
The reflection of \((0,4)\) is  

\[
A'=(0,-4).
\]

---

### Incenter of \(\triangle A'BC\)

Triangle \(A'BC\) has vertices  

\[
A'=(0,-4),\; B=(3,0),\; C=(0,0),
\]

so it is congruent to \(\triangle ABC\) and also right‑angled at \(C\) with legs \(3\) and \(4\).  
Its inradius is the same \(r'=1\).  
Since the legs lie on the positive \(x\)-axis and the negative \(y\)-axis, the incenter is at  

\[
I'=(r',-r')=(1,-1).
\]

---

### Required distance

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{distance}(I,I') &= \sqrt{(1-1)^2+(1-(-1))^2}

\end{cases}
\qquad (a,b,c>0)
\]

Denote  

\[
P=4a^{4}+b^{4}+2b^{2}+4c^{2}.
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.  The first three inequalities

From  

\[
b^{2}+2a\le 10\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad b\le\sqrt{10-2a},
\tag{1}
\]

and  

\[
b^{2}+2a+2c\le 14\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad 
c\le\frac{14-b^{2}-2a}{2}=4-\frac{b^{2}}{2}.
\tag{2}
\]

Because \(c\le b\), the admissible values of \(c\) are

\[
c\le\min\Bigl\{b,\;4-\frac{b^{2}}{2}\Bigr\}.
\tag{3}
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.  The fourth inequality

Write it as  

\[
2a^{3}+2b^{3}+2a+2b-(a^{2}+1)(b^{2}+1)-4ab\ge 0 .
\tag{4}
\]

Factorising the left–hand side gives  

\[
\bigl(a-b\bigr)^{2}\bigl(a+b-2\bigr)\ge 0 .
\tag{5}
\]

Indeed,

\[
\begin{aligned}
&2a^{3}+2b^{3}+2a+2b-(a^{2}+1)(b^{2}+1)-4ab\\
&=a^{3}+b^{3}+a+b-(a^{2}b^{2}+a^{2}+b^{2}+1+4ab)\\
&=(a-b)^{2}(a+b-2).
\end{aligned}
\]

Since \(a>b>0\), inequality (5) is equivalent to  

\[
a+b\ge 2 .
\tag{6}
\]

Thus the fourth condition imposes only the harmless restriction
\(a+b\ge 2\), which is automatically satisfied for all admissible
triples (the smallest possible values are \(a> b>0\)).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.  Where can the maximum of \(P\) be attained?

All terms in \(P\) are increasing functions of \(a,b,c\).  
Consequently the maximum of \(P\) must be attained on the
boundary of the feasible region, i.e. when the inequalities (1)–(3)
are equalities.

* From (1) we want the largest possible \(a\); the upper bound is
\(a\le 3\).  
  Take \(a=3\).

* With \(a=3\), (1) gives \(b^{2}\le 4\), hence the largest admissible
\(b\) is \(b=2\) (and \(b<a\) is satisfied).

* For \(a=3,\;b=2\), (2) yields \(c\le 2\).  
  Because also \(c\le b\), the greatest possible value is \(c=2\).

All three equalities are compatible with (6) (indeed \(a+b=5\ge2\)).
Thus the point  

\[
(a,b,c)=(3,2,2)
\]

belongs to the admissible set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4.  Value of \(P\) at the candidate point

\[
\begin{aligned}
P_{\max}&=4\cdot 3^{4}+2^{4}+2\cdot 2^{2}+4\cdot 2^{2}\\
&=4\cdot 81+16+8+16\\
&=324+40\\
&=364 .
\end{aligned}
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 5.  No larger value is possible

*If \(a<3\):*  
From (1) we have \(b\le\sqrt{10-2a}<2\).  
Then \(b^{4}+2b^{2}<2^{4}+2\cdot2^{2}=24\) and
\(4a^{4}<4\cdot3^{4}=324\).  
Even taking the maximal admissible \(c\le2\) (so \(4c^{2}\le16\)),
the total \(P\) is strictly less than \(324+24+16=364\).

*If \(a=3\) but \(b<2\):*  
From (2) we obtain \(c\le 4-\frac{b^{2}}{2}<2\).  
Both \(b^{4}+2b^{2}\) and \(4c^{2}\) are then smaller than the
corresponding values at \(b=c=2\), while the term \(4a^{4}=324\) stays
the same. Hence \(P<364\).

Thus no admissible triple can give a value of \(P\) larger than 364.

"You are given a word problem involving basic arithmetic, algebra, or geometry. Your task is to carefully read the problem and provide a step-by-step solution for it.",math reasoning,Jackrong/GPT-OSS-120B-Distilled-Reasoning-math,"A car drives up a hill. It reaches point $A$  and then passes 30 m in the first second and 2 m less than during the preceding second for every subsequent second. Nine seconds after the car reached point $A$, a bus starts from point $B$, which is 258 m from $A$, and drives towards the car. In the first second the bus covers 2 m and then it makes 1 m more than during the preceding second for every subsequent second. What distance did the bus cover before it met the car?","**Let the car’s motion start at the instant it reaches point A.**  

- In the first second it goes \(30\;{\rm m}\).  
- Each following second it goes \(2\;{\rm m}\) less than the preceding one.

Hence the distance the car covers in its \(n^{\text{th}}\) second is  

\[
d_c(n)=30-2(n-1)=32-2n\qquad (n=1,2,\dots )
\]

The bus starts **9 s later** from point B, which is \(258\;{\rm m}\) from A, and moves toward the car.

- In its first second it goes \(2\;{\rm m}\).  
- Each following second it goes \(1\;{\rm m}\) more than the preceding one.

Thus the bus distance in its \(k^{\text{th}}\) second is  

\[
d_b(k)=2+(k-1)=k+1\qquad (k=1,2,\dots )
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.  Distance the car has already covered when the bus starts

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=1}^{9} d_c(n) &=
\sum_{n=1}^{9} (32-2n)\\
&=9\cdot 32-2\frac{9\cdot10}{2}=288-90=198\;{\rm m}.
\end{aligned}
\]

So after 9 s the separation between the car and the bus is  

\[
258-198 = 60\;{\rm m}.
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.  Motion after the bus starts

From the 10‑th second onward the car’s per‑second distances are  

\[
12,\;10,\;8,\;6,\;4,\;2,\;0,\dots
\]

(the 10‑th second corresponds to \(d_c(10)=32-20=12\) m, etc.).

The bus’s per‑second distances are  

\[
2,\;3,\;4,\;5,\;6,\;7,\;8,\dots
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.  Find when the two together cover the remaining 60 m

Create cumulative sums (after the bus has been moving for \(t\) seconds).

| \(t\) (s) | Car distance (m) | Bus distance (m) | Total (m) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 12 | 2 | 14 |
| 2 | 22 | 5 | 27 |
| 3 | 30 | 9 | 39 |
| 4 | 36 | 14 | 50 |
| 5 | 40 | 20 | **60** |

At \(t=5\) s the combined distance equals the remaining separation of 60 m, so the meeting occurs exactly 5 seconds after the bus starts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4.  Distance travelled by the bus

The bus’s cumulative distance after 5 seconds is  

\[
2+3+4+5+6 = 20\;{\rm m}.

Points A and B are on XY such that X, A, O, B, Y are in this order and AO = OB = 4. Suppose P is a point on the circle such that the lines PA and PB intersect the circle again at points C and D, respectively. Given that PB/BD = 16/21, find PA/AC.","Let the circle have centre \(O(0,0)\) and radius \(10\).  
Take the diameter \(XY\) as the \(x\)-axis, so  

\[
X=(-10,0),\qquad A=(-4,0),\qquad O=(0,0),\qquad B=(4,0),\qquad Y=(10,0).
\]

---

### 1.  Power of the interior points \(A\) and \(B\)

For any point \(Q\) inside the circle, the product of the distances from \(Q\) to the two intersection points of any line through \(Q\) with the circle equals the power of \(Q\):

\[
\text{Power}(Q)=R^{2}-OQ^{2}.
\]

Since \(OA=OB=4\),

\[
\text{Power}(A)=\text{Power}(B)=10^{2}-4^{2}=100-16=84.
\]

Hence for the chords through \(A\) and \(B\),

\[
PA\cdot AC =84,\qquad PB\cdot BD =84. \tag{1}
\]

---

### 2.  Use the given ratio for \(PB\) and \(BD\)

Given \(\displaystyle\frac{PB}{BD}= \frac{16}{21}\), write  

\[
PB=16k,\qquad BD=21k .
\]

From (1) for point \(B\),

\[
(16k)(21k)=84\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 336k^{2}=84\quad\Longrightarrow\quad k^{2}=\frac14,
\]
so \(k=\frac12\) (positive lengths). Therefore  

\[
PB=8,\qquad BD=10.5 .
\]

---

### 3.  Locate point \(P\)

Let \(P=(x,y)\) on the circle \(x^{2}+y^{2}=100\).  
Since \(PB=8\),

\[
(x-4)^{2}+y^{2}=8^{2}=64.
\]

Subtract the circle equation:

\[
(x-4)^{2}+y^{2}-\bigl(x^{2}+y^{2}\bigr)=64-100\Longrightarrow -8x+16=-36,
\]
hence  

\[
x=\frac{52}{8}=6.5 .
\]

Then  

\[
y^{2}=100-x^{2}=100-6.5^{2}=100-42.25=57.75 .
\]

Thus \(P=(6.5,\pm\sqrt{57.75})\).

---

### 4.  Compute \(PA\)

Point \(A=(-4,0)\). Using the coordinates of \(P\),

\[
PA^{2}=(x+4)^{2}+y^{2}=(6.5+4)^{2}+57.75=10.5^{2}+57.75=110.25+57.75=168.
\]

Hence  

\[
PA=\sqrt{168}=2\sqrt{42}.
\]

---

### 5.  Find \(PA/AC\)

From (1) for point \(A\),

\[
PA\cdot AC =84\quad\Longrightarrow\quad AC=\frac{84}{PA}
           =\frac{84}{2\sqrt{42}}=\frac{42}{\sqrt{42}}=\sqrt{42}.
\]

Therefore  

\[
\frac{PA}{AC}= \frac{2\sqrt{42}}{\sqrt{42}} = 2.

and denote  

\[
b_n=\bigl\lfloor a_n\bigr\rfloor .

Because \(\lfloor x+k\rfloor =\lfloor x\rfloor +k\) for any integer \(k\),

\[

The characteristic equation is  

\[
x^{2}=x+2\quad\Longrightarrow\quad x^{2}-x-2=0,
\]

with roots \(x=2\) and \(x=-1\).  
Hence  

\[
b_n=A\cdot2^{\,n-1}+B\cdot(-1)^{\,n-1}.
\]

Using \(b_1=b_2=1\),

\[
\begin{cases}
A+B=1,\\[2pt]
2A-B=1,
\end{cases}\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad A=\frac23,\; B=\frac13 .

Therefore  

\[
\boxed{\,b_n=\frac{2^{\,n}+(-1)^{\,n-1}}{3}\,}.
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.  Computing \(b_{2021}\pmod{100}\)

We need the last two digits of \(b_{2021}\).  
Write  

\[
b_{2021}= \frac{2^{2021}+(-1)^{2020}}{3}= \frac{2^{2021}+1}{3}.
\]

To obtain this modulo \(100\) we compute the numerator modulo \(300\) (because
\(3\cdot100=300\)).

---

#### 3.1  \(2^{2021}\pmod{300}\)

Use the Chinese remainder theorem with \(300=4\cdot75\).

* Mod \(4\): for any exponent \(\ge 2\), \(2^{k}\equiv0\pmod4\).  
  Hence \(2^{2021}\equiv0\pmod4\).

* Mod \(75\): \(\gcd(2,75)=1\) and \(\varphi(75)=40\).  
  \(2021\equiv 21\pmod{40}\), so  

  \[
  2^{2021}\equiv 2^{21}\pmod{75}.
  \]

  Computing powers modulo \(75\):

  \[
  2^{20}\equiv1\pmod{75}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 2^{21}\equiv2\pmod{75}.
  \]

Thus  

\[
2^{2021}\equiv 0\pmod4,\qquad 2^{2021}\equiv 2\pmod{75}.
\]

The unique number \(x\) with these two congruences is obtained from  

\[
x=4k,\qquad 4k\equiv2\pmod{75}\;\Longrightarrow\;k\equiv2\cdot19\equiv38\pmod{75},
\]

so \(x=4\cdot38=152\) (mod \(300\)). Hence  

\[
2^{2021}\equiv 152\pmod{300}.
\]

---

#### 3.2  Numerator modulo \(300\)

\[
2^{2021}+1\equiv 152+1\equiv 153\pmod{300}.
\]

Since \(153\) is divisible by \(3\),

\[
b_{2021}= \frac{2^{2021}+1}{3}\equiv \frac{153}{3}=51\pmod{100}.
\]
