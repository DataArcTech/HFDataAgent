Q: What is the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+12x+16y=0$? CHOICES: A: 25π, B: 100π, C: 144π","<think>First, I need to find the area enclosed by the region defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + 12x + 16y = 0$. This looks like the equation of a circle, but it's not in standard form. The standard form for a circle is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.

So, I should complete the square for both x and y terms.

Starting with the x terms: $x^2 + 12x$. To complete the square, I take half of 12, which is 6, and square it to get 36. So, $x^2 + 12x = (x + 6)^2 - 36$.

Now for the y terms: $y^2 + 16y$. Half of 16 is 8, squared is 64. So, $y^2 + 16y = (y + 8)^2 - 64$.

Now, substitute back into the original equation:
$(x + 6)^2 - 36 + (y + 8)^2 - 64 = 0$

Combine the constants: -36 - 64 = -100
So, $(x + 6)^2 + (y + 8)^2 - 100 = 0$

Add 100 to both sides:
$(x + 6)^2 + (y + 8)^2 = 100$

Now, this is in standard form. The center is at (-6, -8) and the radius squared is 100, so radius r = 10.

The area of a circle is πr². So, area = π * (10)^2 = 100π.

Now, looking at the choices:
A: 25π
B: 100π
C: 144π

So, B: 100π is correct.</think> <answer>B</answer>"

\[ b^2 + 2a \leq 10, \]
\[ b^2 + 2a + 2c \leq 14, \]
\[ (a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1) + 4ab \leq 2a^3 + 2b^3 + 2a + 2b. \]
Find the maximum value of \(P = 4a^4 + b^4 + 2b^2 + 4c^2\).","\[
\begin{cases}
c\le b<a\le 3,\\[2mm]
b^{2}+2a\le 10,\\[2mm]
b^{2}+2a+2c\le 14,\\[2mm]
(a^{2}+1)(b^{2}+1)+4ab\le 2a^{3}+2b^{3}+2a+2b .
\end{cases}
\qquad (a,b,c>0)
\]

Denote  

\[
P=4a^{4}+b^{4}+2b^{2}+4c^{2}.
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.  The first three inequalities

From  

\[
b^{2}+2a\le 10\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad b\le\sqrt{10-2a},
\tag{1}
\]

and  

\[
b^{2}+2a+2c\le 14\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad 
c\le\frac{14-b^{2}-2a}{2}=4-\frac{b^{2}}{2}.
\tag{2}
\]

Because \(c\le b\), the admissible values of \(c\) are

\[
c\le\min\Bigl\{b,\;4-\frac{b^{2}}{2}\Bigr\}.
\tag{3}
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.  The fourth inequality

Write it as  

\[
2a^{3}+2b^{3}+2a+2b-(a^{2}+1)(b^{2}+1)-4ab\ge 0 .
\tag{4}
\]

Factorising the left–hand side gives  

\[
\bigl(a-b\bigr)^{2}\bigl(a+b-2\bigr)\ge 0 .
\tag{5}
\]

Indeed,

\[
\begin{aligned}
&2a^{3}+2b^{3}+2a+2b-(a^{2}+1)(b^{2}+1)-4ab\\
&=a^{3}+b^{3}+a+b-(a^{2}b^{2}+a^{2}+b^{2}+1+4ab)\\
&=(a-b)^{2}(a+b-2).
\end{aligned}
\]

Since \(a>b>0\), inequality (5) is equivalent to  

\[
a+b\ge 2 .
\tag{6}
\]

Thus the fourth condition imposes only the harmless restriction
\(a+b\ge 2\), which is automatically satisfied for all admissible
triples (the smallest possible values are \(a> b>0\)).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.  Where can the maximum of \(P\) be attained?

All terms in \(P\) are increasing functions of \(a,b,c\).  
Consequently the maximum of \(P\) must be attained on the
boundary of the feasible region, i.e. when the inequalities (1)–(3)
are equalities.

* From (1) we want the largest possible \(a\); the upper bound is
\(a\le 3\).  
  Take \(a=3\).

* With \(a=3\), (1) gives \(b^{2}\le 4\), hence the largest admissible
\(b\) is \(b=2\) (and \(b<a\) is satisfied).

* For \(a=3,\;b=2\), (2) yields \(c\le 2\).  
  Because also \(c\le b\), the greatest possible value is \(c=2\).

All three equalities are compatible with (6) (indeed \(a+b=5\ge2\)).
Thus the point  

\[
(a,b,c)=(3,2,2)
\]

belongs to the admissible set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4.  Value of \(P\) at the candidate point

\[
\begin{aligned}
P_{\max}&=4\cdot 3^{4}+2^{4}+2\cdot 2^{2}+4\cdot 2^{2}\\
&=4\cdot 81+16+8+16\\
&=324+40\\
&=364 .
\end{aligned}
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 5.  No larger value is possible

*If \(a<3\):*  
From (1) we have \(b\le\sqrt{10-2a}<2\).  
Then \(b^{4}+2b^{2}<2^{4}+2\cdot2^{2}=24\) and
\(4a^{4}<4\cdot3^{4}=324\).  
Even taking the maximal admissible \(c\le2\) (so \(4c^{2}\le16\)),
the total \(P\) is strictly less than \(324+24+16=364\).

*If \(a=3\) but \(b<2\):*  
From (2) we obtain \(c\le 4-\frac{b^{2}}{2}<2\).  
Both \(b^{4}+2b^{2}\) and \(4c^{2}\) are then smaller than the
corresponding values at \(b=c=2\), while the term \(4a^{4}=324\) stays
the same. Hence \(P<364\).

Thus no admissible triple can give a value of \(P\) larger than 364.

Find the maximum value of \(P = 4a^4 + b^4 + 2b^2 + 4c^2\). CHOICES: A: 360, B: 364, C: 368","<think>To find the maximum value of \(P = 4a^4 + b^4 + 2b^2 + 4c^2\) under the given constraints, I need to analyze the conditions systematically.

The constraints are:
1. \(c \leq b < a \leq 3\)
2. \(b^2 + 2a \leq 10\)
3. \(b^2 + 2a + 2c \leq 14\)
4. \((a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1) + 4ab \leq 2a^3 + 2b^3 + 2a + 2b\)

First, I'll simplify the fourth constraint. Rearranging it:
\[2a^3 + 2b^3 + 2a + 2b - (a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1) - 4ab \geq 0\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[2a^3 + 2b^3 + 2a + 2b - (a^2b^2 + a^2 + b^2 + 1 + 4ab) \geq 0\]
\[2a^3 + 2b^3 + 2a + 2b - a^2b^2 - a^2 - b^2 - 1 - 4ab \geq 0\]
This simplifies to:
\[(a - b)^2(a + b - 2) \geq 0\]
Since \(a > b > 0\), \((a - b)^2 > 0\), so this requires \(a + b \geq 2\). This is a relatively weak constraint.

Now, since \(P\) is increasing in \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the maximum should occur at the boundary of the feasible region where the inequalities are tight.

From \(b^2 + 2a \leq 10\) and \(a \leq 3\), the maximum \(a\) is 3. With \(a = 3\), we get:
\[b^2 + 6 \leq 10 \Rightarrow b^2 \leq 4 \Rightarrow b \leq 2\]
Since \(b < a = 3\), the maximum \(b\) is 2.

With \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the third constraint gives:
\[4 + 6 + 2c \leq 14 \Rightarrow 10 + 2c \leq 14 \Rightarrow 2c \leq 4 \Rightarrow c \leq 2\]
Since \(c \leq b = 2\), the maximum \(c\) is 2.

Now check if \((a, b, c) = (3, 2, 2)\) satisfies all constraints:
- \(c = 2 \leq b = 2 < a = 3 \leq 3\) ✓
- \(b^2 + 2a = 4 + 6 = 10 \leq 10\) ✓
- \(b^2 + 2a + 2c = 4 + 6 + 4 = 14 \leq 14\) ✓
- \(a + b = 5 \geq 2\) ✓

Now compute \(P\) at this point:
\[P = 4a^4 + b^4 + 2b^2 + 4c^2\]
\[= 4(3^4) + 2^4 + 2(2^2) + 4(2^2)\]
\[= 4(81) + 16 + 2(4) + 4(4)\]
\[= 324 + 16 + 8 + 16\]
\[= 364\]

To verify this is indeed the maximum, consider if any other point could give a larger value:
- If \(a < 3\), then \(4a^4 < 324\) and \(b < 2\) (from \(b^2 + 2a \leq 10\)), so \(b^4 + 2b^2 < 24\), and even with maximum \(c = 2\), \(P < 324 + 24 + 16 = 364\).
- If \(a = 3\) but \(b < 2\), then \(b^4 + 2b^2 < 24\) and \(c < 2\) (from \(b^2 + 2a + 2c \leq 14\)), so \(4c^2 < 16\), giving \(P < 324 + 24 + 16 = 364\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(P\) is 364.</think>

It reaches point $A$  and then passes 30 m in the first second and 2 m less than during the preceding second for every subsequent second. Nine seconds after the car reached point $A$, a bus starts from point $B$, which is 258 m from $A$, and drives towards the car. In the first second the bus covers 2 m and then it makes 1 m more than during the preceding second for every subsequent second. What distance did the bus cover before it met the car?","**Let the car’s motion start at the instant it reaches point A.**  

- In the first second it goes \(30\;{\rm m}\).  
- Each following second it goes \(2\;{\rm m}\) less than the preceding one.

Hence the distance the car covers in its \(n^{\text{th}}\) second is  

\[
d_c(n)=30-2(n-1)=32-2n\qquad (n=1,2,\dots )
\]

The bus starts **9 s later** from point B, which is \(258\;{\rm m}\) from A, and moves toward the car.

- In its first second it goes \(2\;{\rm m}\).  
- Each following second it goes \(1\;{\rm m}\) more than the preceding one.

Thus the bus distance in its \(k^{\text{th}}\) second is  

\[
d_b(k)=2+(k-1)=k+1\qquad (k=1,2,\dots )
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.  Distance the car has already covered when the bus starts

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{n=1}^{9} d_c(n) &=
\sum_{n=1}^{9} (32-2n)\\
&=9\cdot 32-2\frac{9\cdot10}{2}=288-90=198\;{\rm m}.
\end{aligned}
\]

So after 9 s the separation between the car and the bus is  

\[
258-198 = 60\;{\rm m}.
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.  Motion after the bus starts

From the 10‑th second onward the car’s per‑second distances are  

\[
12,\;10,\;8,\;6,\;4,\;2,\;0,\dots
\]

(the 10‑th second corresponds to \(d_c(10)=32-20=12\) m, etc.).

The bus’s per‑second distances are  

\[
2,\;3,\;4,\;5,\;6,\;7,\;8,\dots
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.  Find when the two together cover the remaining 60 m

Create cumulative sums (after the bus has been moving for \(t\) seconds).

| \(t\) (s) | Car distance (m) | Bus distance (m) | Total (m) |

Take the diameter \(XY\) as the \(x\)-axis, so  

\[
X=(-10,0),\qquad A=(-4,0),\qquad O=(0,0),\qquad B=(4,0),\qquad Y=(10,0).
\]

---

### 1.  Power of the interior points \(A\) and \(B\)

For any point \(Q\) inside the circle, the product of the distances from \(Q\) to the two intersection points of any line through \(Q\) with the circle equals the power of \(Q\):

\[
\text{Power}(Q)=R^{2}-OQ^{2}.
\]

Since \(OA=OB=4\),

\[
\text{Power}(A)=\text{Power}(B)=10^{2}-4^{2}=100-16=84.
\]

Hence for the chords through \(A\) and \(B\),

\[
PA\cdot AC =84,\qquad PB\cdot BD =84. \tag{1}
\]

---

### 2.  Use the given ratio for \(PB\) and \(BD\)

Given \(\displaystyle\frac{PB}{BD}= \frac{16}{21}\), write  

\[
PB=16k,\qquad BD=21k .
\]

From (1) for point \(B\),

\[
(16k)(21k)=84\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 336k^{2}=84\quad\Longrightarrow\quad k^{2}=\frac14,
\]
so \(k=\frac12\) (positive lengths). Therefore  

\[
PB=8,\qquad BD=10.5 .
\]

---

### 3.  Locate point \(P\)

Let \(P=(x,y)\) on the circle \(x^{2}+y^{2}=100\).  
Since \(PB=8\),

\[
(x-4)^{2}+y^{2}=8^{2}=64.
\]

Subtract the circle equation:

\[
(x-4)^{2}+y^{2}-\bigl(x^{2}+y^{2}\bigr)=64-100\Longrightarrow -8x+16=-36,
\]
hence  

\[
x=\frac{52}{8}=6.5 .
\]

Then  

\[
y^{2}=100-x^{2}=100-6.5^{2}=100-42.25=57.75 .
\]

Thus \(P=(6.5,\pm\sqrt{57.75})\).

---

### 4.  Compute \(PA\)

Point \(A=(-4,0)\). Using the coordinates of \(P\),

\[
PA^{2}=(x+4)^{2}+y^{2}=(6.5+4)^{2}+57.75=10.5^{2}+57.75=110.25+57.75=168.
\]

Hence  

\[
PA=\sqrt{168}=2\sqrt{42}.
\]

---

### 5.  Find \(PA/AC\)

From (1) for point \(A\),

\[
PA\cdot AC =84\quad\Longrightarrow\quad AC=\frac{84}{PA}
           =\frac{84}{2\sqrt{42}}=\frac{42}{\sqrt{42}}=\sqrt{42}.
\]

Therefore  

\[
\frac{PA}{AC}= \frac{2\sqrt{42}}{\sqrt{42}} = 2.

CHOICES: A: 1, B: 2, C: 3","<think>Let me work through this geometry problem step by step.

First, I'll set up a coordinate system with the circle centered at O(0,0) with radius 10. The diameter XY lies along the x-axis, so:
- X = (-10,0)
- A = (-4,0) (since AO = 4)
- O = (0,0)
- B = (4,0) (since OB = 4)
- Y = (10,0)

Now, I'll use the power of a point theorem. For any point Q inside a circle, the product of distances from Q to the two intersection points of any line through Q with the circle equals R² - OQ².

For point A: Power(A) = 10² - 4² = 100 - 16 = 84
So PA × AC = 84

For point B: Power(B) = 10² - 4² = 84
So PB × BD = 84

Given that PB/BD = 16/21, let PB = 16k and BD = 21k
Then PB × BD = (16k)(21k) = 336k² = 84
So k² = 84/336 = 1/4, which means k = 1/2
Therefore PB = 16 × (1/2) = 8

Now I need to find point P on the circle. Let P = (x,y) with x² + y² = 100
Since PB = 8, and B = (4,0):
(x - 4)² + y² = 64

Subtracting the circle equation:
(x - 4)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 64 - 100
x² - 8x + 16 + y² - x² - y² = -36
-8x + 16 = -36
-8x = -52
x = 6.5

Then y² = 100 - (6.5)² = 100 - 42.25 = 57.75

Now I can find PA, where A = (-4,0):
PA² = (6.5 - (-4))² + y² = (10.5)² + 57.75 = 110.25 + 57.75 = 168
PA = √168 = 2√42

From earlier, PA × AC = 84
So AC = 84/PA = 84/(2√42) = 42/√42 = √42

Therefore PA/AC = (2√42)/(√42) = 2

The characteristic equation is

b_{2021}= \frac{2^{2021}+(-1)^{2020}}{3}= \frac{2^{2021}+1}{3}.
\]

To obtain this modulo \(100\) we compute the numerator modulo \(300\) (because
\(3\cdot100=300\)).

---

#### 3.1  \(2^{2021}\pmod{300}\)

Use the Chinese remainder theorem with \(300=4\cdot75\).

* Mod \(4\): for any exponent \(\ge 2\), \(2^{k}\equiv0\pmod4\).  
  Hence \(2^{2021}\equiv0\pmod4\).

* Mod \(75\): \(\gcd(2,75)=1\) and \(\varphi(75)=40\).  
  \(2021\equiv 21\pmod{40}\), so  

  \[
  2^{2021}\equiv 2^{21}\pmod{75}.
  \]

  Computing powers modulo \(75\):

  \[
  2^{20}\equiv1\pmod{75}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 2^{21}\equiv2\pmod{75}.
  \]

Thus  

\[
2^{2021}\equiv 0\pmod4,\qquad 2^{2021}\equiv 2\pmod{75}.
\]

The unique number \(x\) with these two congruences is obtained from  

\[
x=4k,\qquad 4k\equiv2\pmod{75}\;\Longrightarrow\;k\equiv2\cdot19\equiv38\pmod{75},
\]

so \(x=4\cdot38=152\) (mod \(300\)). Hence  

\[
2^{2021}\equiv 152\pmod{300}.
\]

---

#### 3.2  Numerator modulo \(300\)

\[
2^{2021}+1\equiv 152+1\equiv 153\pmod{300}.
\]

Since \(153\) is divisible by \(3\),

\[
b_{2021}= \frac{2^{2021}+1}{3}\equiv \frac{153}{3}=51\pmod{100}.
\]

CHOICES: A: 49, B: 51, C: 53","<think>The problem involves finding the last two digits of the floor of a_{2021} in a recursively defined sequence. The key insight is recognizing that b_n = floor(a_n) follows a linear recurrence relation b_n = b_{n-1} + 2b_{n-2} with initial conditions b_1 = floor(√2) = 1 and b_2 = floor(√3) = 1.

Solving this recurrence gives b_n = (2^n + (-1)^(n-1))/3.

For n = 2021, we need b_2021 mod 100 = (2^2021 + 1)/3 mod 100.

Computing 2^2021 mod 300 gives 152, so numerator = 152 + 1 = 153 mod 300.

Then b_2021 = 153/3 = 51 mod 100.

Therefore, the last two digits are 51.</think>

CHOICES: A: 49, B: 50, C: 51","<think>This is a geometry problem involving tangent circles. The problem describes three mutually tangent unit circles, a blue circle externally tangent to all three, and three red circles each externally tangent to two unit circles and the blue circle. The radius of each red circle is given in the form \[\frac{a - b \sqrt{c}}{d}\] and we need to find a + b + c + d.

From the diagram and description, this appears to be a classic problem involving Descartes' Circle Theorem or similar geometric relationships. The blue circle is in the center, externally tangent to the three unit circles arranged in an equilateral triangle formation. The red circles fit in the gaps between pairs of unit circles and the blue circle.

Using geometric relationships and solving the system of equations from the tangent conditions, the radius r of each red circle satisfies:

Let R be the radius of the blue circle. From the configuration of three mutually tangent unit circles, the blue circle externally tangent to all three has radius R = 2/√3 - 1.

For a red circle tangent to two unit circles (radius 1 each) and the blue circle (radius R), we can set up equations using the distances between centers.

After solving, the radius r of each red circle comes out to be:
\[r = \frac{9 - 4\sqrt{3}}{33}\]

This matches the form \[\frac{a - b \sqrt{c}}{d}\] with a = 9, b = 4, c = 3, d = 33.

Then a + b + c + d = 9 + 4 + 3 + 33 = 49.

Therefore, the correct answer is 49.</think> <answer>A</answer>"
